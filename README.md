# REGISTER NUMBER : 212223040082
# Aim: 
To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 
1. Straightforward Prompts
2. Tabular Format Prompting
3.Preceding Question Prompting and
4. Missing Word Prompting

# Explanation - 
Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type
Procedure:
## 1.	Straightforward Prompts:
     •	"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
     •	"List three advantages of electric vehicles."
     
Prompts:
    • "Define renewable energy in one sentence."
    • "List three advantages of solar energy."

Responses :
    • Renewable energy is energy derived from naturally replenishing sources such as sunlight, wind, and water.
    • Advantages:
        • Reduces greenhouse gas emissions
        • Low operating costs after installation
        • Provides sustainable long-term energy
        
 ## 2.	Tabular Format Prompting:
     •	"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."
     •	"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."

Prompt:
    • "Provide a table comparing Solar Energy, Wind Energy, and Hydropower based on Source, Efficiency, and One Use Case each."

Responses :
| Energy Type  | Source                     | Efficiency Range | Example Use Case            |
| ------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| Solar Energy | Sunlight (photovoltaic)    | 15% – 22%        | Rooftop solar panels        |
| Wind Energy  | Moving air (wind turbines) | 30% – 45%        | Offshore/onshore wind farms |
| Hydropower   | Flowing water (dams)       | 35% – 50%        | Electricity from hydro dams |

## 3. Preceding Question Prompting:
    •	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."
    •	"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."
    
Prompt:
    • "Why is renewable energy important? Explain how solar and wind energy help reduce climate change."

Responses :
    • Renewable energy is important because it provides clean, sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Solar and wind energy reduce climate change by lowering carbon dioxide emissions, decreasing dependency on        coal and oil, and offering eco-friendly power solutions.
    
## 4. Missing Word Prompting:
   •	"The capital of France is ____."
   •	"In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____."

Prompts:
    • "The primary source of solar energy is the ____."
    • "Wind turbines convert moving ____ into electricity."

Responses :
    • The primary source of solar energy is the Sun.
    • Wind turbines convert moving air into electricity.

### Conclusion :
Different types of prompting (Straightforward, Tabular Format, Preceding Question, and Missing Word) were applied to the use case of renewable energy. The results show how prompt design influences clarity, structure, and completeness of responses.

# Result:
The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
