# Aim: 

To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method 

1. Straightforward Prompts
 
2. Tabular Format Prompting
 
3.Preceding Question Prompting

4. Missing Word Prompting

# Explanation - 

Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type

## Procedure:

## 1.	Straightforward Prompts:


**Definition:**  
A straightforward prompt is a direct instruction or question given to the model without adding extra context, refinements, or constraints.  

**Use Case Example**  

**Domain:** Healthcare  
 
**Expected Output:**  
- Frequent urination  
- Excessive thirst  
- Unexplained weight loss  
- Blurred vision  
- Fatigue  

**Prompt :**
"Define renewable energy in one sentence."

Output : 
Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished continuously, such as sunlight, wind, water, and biomass.

**Prompt :**
"List three advantages of solar energy."

Output :
- Reduces electricity bills  
- Environmentally friendly with low carbon emissions  
- Provides renewable and sustainable power source

___

 ## 2.	Tabular Format Prompting:

**Definition:**
Tabular Format Prompting is a prompting technique where the input and/or expected output are structured in a table. This helps organize information clearly, making it easier for the model to interpret and generate structured responses.

**Use Case Example** 

**Domain:** Renewable Energy

**Expected Output:**
Fill the table with the type of renewable energy, its main source, and one advantage.
| Renewable Energy | Source         | Advantage              |
|------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Solar Energy     | ?              | ?                      |
| Wind Energy      | ?              | ?                      |
| Hydropower       | ?              | ?                      |

**Prompt :**
"Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."

Output : 

| Feature                | AC (Alternating Current)                   | DC (Direct Current)                   |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Flow of Current         | Changes direction periodically             | Flows in one constant direction        |
| Source                  | Power stations, generators                 | Batteries, solar cells                 |
| Transmission            | Suitable for long-distance transmission    | Not efficient for long distances       |
| Voltage Level           | Can be easily stepped up or down using transformers | Fixed voltage, harder to change levels |
| Applications            | Household appliances, power supply grid    | Electronic devices, laptops, mobiles   |

**Prompt :**
"Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."

Output :

| Programming Language | Paradigm(s)                     | Use Case Example                        |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Python               | Object-Oriented, Procedural, Functional | Machine Learning and Data Science       |
| Java                 | Object-Oriented                 | Enterprise Applications and Android Apps|
| C                    | Procedural, Structured          | Operating Systems and Embedded Systems  |
| JavaScript           | Event-Driven, Functional, Object-Oriented | Web Development (Frontend & Backend)   |
| Haskell              | Functional                      | Academic Research and Compiler Design   |

___

## 3. Preceding Question Prompting:

**Definition:**

Preceding Question Prompting is a technique where a series of related questions are asked step by step, with each new question depending on the previous one. It helps guide the model gradually toward a detailed or structured answer.

**Use Case Example:**

**Domain:** Programming Languages

**Prompt :**

"What is Python?"

**Output :**

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility.

**Prompt :**

"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."

**Output :**

Why is climate change a global concern?

Climate change is a global concern because it causes rising sea levels, extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, food insecurity, and serious risks to human health and economies worldwide.

Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.

Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, preventing it from escaping into space, which leads to an increase in global temperatures.

___

## 4. Missing Word Prompting:

**Definition:**

Missing Word Prompting involves providing a partial sentence or statement with one or more blanks, asking the AI to predict or generate the missing word(s) appropriately.

**Prompt :**

The capital of France is ____.

**Output :**

Paris

**Prompt :**

The programming language used for web development that starts with 'J' is ____.

**Output :**

JavaScript

### Conclusion :
Different types of prompting (Straightforward, Tabular Format, Preceding Question, and Missing Word) were applied to the use case of renewable energy. The results show how prompt design influences clarity, structure, and completeness of responses.

# Result:
The various types of Prompts are executed successfully with generated the report.
